## Authentication System

The application uses a JWT-based authentication system:

- **Sign Up**: Users can create a new account with name, email, and password
- **Sign In**: Existing users can sign in with email and password
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware automatically protects routes that require authentication
- **User Profile**: Authenticated users can access their profile information
- **Token Storage**: Authentication tokens are stored in both localStorage and cookies
- **JWT Verification**: Server-side verification of tokens for protected routes

## Chat Features

- **Healthcare Knowledge Base**: Built-in responses for common health topics
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Dynamically updated chat suggestions based on conversation
- **Conversation History**: For authenticated users, chat history is maintained
- **Personalized Responses**: Users who are logged in receive personalized interactions
- **OpenAI Integration**: Advanced AI responses when built-in knowledge is insufficient
- **Health Disclaimers**: Clear healthcare disclaimers to ensure proper use

## Database Integration

The application uses PostgreSQL for data storage:

- **User Management**: Securely stores user information with encrypted passwords
- **Chat History**: Logs conversation history for authenticated users
- **Connection Pool**: Efficient connection management for database operations

## Extending the Chatbot

### Adding More Health Topics

To add more built-in responses to common health queries, edit the `healthcareKnowledgeBase` object in `src/lib/chatbot.ts`:

```typescript
const healthcareKnowledgeBase = {
  // Existing topics...
  'new-topic': 'Your response about the new health topic here.',
};
```

### Customizing the Authentication System

To implement a production-ready authentication system:

1. Connect to a production PostgreSQL database by updating environment variables
2. Implement additional security features like email verification, password reset
3. Configure session timeouts and refresh token rotation

### Customizing the UI

The chat interface and authentication forms can be customized by editing the components in the `src/components` directory. The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
